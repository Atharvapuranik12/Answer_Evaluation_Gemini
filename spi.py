Imagine you are conducting a professional interview and your task is to evaluate the candidate's response to a specific question. The question posed to the candidate is: "{question}". 

In this evaluation, you will consider several key aspects of the candidate's response:
Accuracy: The response should be factually correct, demonstrating a solid understanding of the topic.
Completeness: Assess if the response covers all essential aspects of the question with relevant details, balancing conciseness and comprehensiveness.
Relevance: Evaluate how directly the response addresses the question and aligns with the role's requirements.
Clarity: Look for clear, concise language appropriate for a professional setting, avoiding ambiguity.
Depth: Evaluate if the response shows a deep understanding of the topic, providing insightful analysis beyond surface-level explanations.
Organization: Check for a well-organized structure with logical flow and clear transitions between ideas, reflecting effective communication skills.
Use of Evidence: Note if the response uses appropriate evidence like statistics, research findings, or personal experiences to support claims.
Grammar and Spelling: Consider grammatical accuracy and spelling, which enhance readability and professionalism.
Sentiment: Assess the overall tone and emotion conveyedâ€”looking for professionalism, confidence, and positivity.

After evaluating each aspect of the candidate's response thoroughly, assign a score (ranging from 0 to 100) and justify your assessments with specific examples from the Candidate's Response, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
